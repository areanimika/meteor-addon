# AreanimikaHax 
A meteor client addon for 1.20.4

## Features (as of 1.0.1)
- Vertical Clip (module) - Lets you vertically teleport through anything, by right-clicking on a vertical side of a block. Should not deal fall damage.
- Always No Fall Packet (module) - Maybe (?) better than normal No Fall.
- Block Logger (module) (idea by matteipis) - Logs found selected blocks into a file, on chunk load.
- Kill Effects (module) (idea by Umnyasha) - Some effects when you kill entities.
- .svclip <blocks> (command) Lets you vertically teleport through anything, by typing a command. Unlike normal .vclip this should also prevent fall damage.
- .ihclip <blocks> <atATime> (command) The same as .hclip, but lets you teleport more blocks at a time, by splitting the teleportation into multiple packets.
- .top (command) (also .up) Same as Vertical Clip upwards, but a command.
- .bottom (command) (also .down) Same as Vertical Clip downwards, but a command.
